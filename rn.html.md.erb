## <a id="3-13-0"></a> Release Notes for Concourse v3.13.0
**Release Date: June 4, 2018**

<p class="note warning"><strong>Warning: </strong>To protect against clickjacking, set the <code>x_frame_options</code> property for the atc job to <code>deny</code> or <code>sameorigin</code> instead of <code>allow-from</code>.<br>For more information, see <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/X-Frame-Options">X-Frame-Options</a>in the Mozilla documentation.</p>

###<a id="security-3130"></a> Security Fix: Action Required

To protect against the runC container breakout CVE, you must do the following:

* Update Garden RunC to v1.18.2.

    For more information, see [garden-runc/1.18.2](https://bosh.io/releases/github.com/cloudfoundry/garden-runc-release?version=1.18.2) in the BOSH documentation.

* Update your stemcell to Xenial v250.x.

    For more information, see [Stemcells](https://bosh.io/stemcells/) and [Uploading Stemcells](https://bosh.io/docs/uploading-stemcells/) in the BOSH documentation.

For more information about this CVE,
see [CVE 2019-5736: runC container breakout](https://pivotal.io/security/cve-2019-5736).


###<a id="bosh-release"></a>BOSH Release
* The `groundcrew` job has been renamed to `worker` in this release of Concourse.
  Update your BOSH manifest.<br><br>
  For more information, see
  [worker job from concour  se/3.13.0](http://bosh.io/jobs/worker?source=github.com/concourse/concourse&version=3.13.0)
  in the BOSH documentation.
  For additional usage information and sample manifests,
  see the `operations` directory in the
  [Concourse BOSH deployment](https://github.com/concourse/concourse-bosh-deployment/tree/v3.13.0/cluster/operations)
  GitHub repository.


###<a id="known-issues"></a>Known Issues
<p class="note warning"><strong> Warning:</strong>
  A bug in Chrome 67 causes it to crash when loading the Concourse UI.  At the
  time of this notice (June 4, 2018), Chrome Dev and Chrome Canary versions probably work
  as well as other browsers like Firefox and Safari.
  You can follow issue <a href="https://github.com/concourse/concourse/issues/2236">#2236</a> in GitHub.
</p>

* This release involves a worker protocol version bump, from v1.3 to v2.0, and
it switches the default `BaggageClaim` driver back to `btrfs`.

    Pivotal recommends spinning up a new pool of worker nodes, upgrading your web nodes,
and then removing the old workers.
Otherwise your workers might get swarmed with containers,
because only one 2.0 worker is added at a time with the web nodes already upgraded.

* Concourse now defaults the worker `registration_mode` to `direct`. If your
Concourse installation uses external workers, verify that your worker
manifest explicitly specifies `registration_mode:forward`. For information
about this new parameter, see
[registration_mode](https://bosh.io/jobs/worker?source=github.com/concourse/concourse&version=3.13.0#p%3dtsa.registration_mode)
in the BOSH documentation.

###<a id="features"></a> Features
* Added a new authentication provider for teams using OpenID Connect (OIDC) ([PR #2](https://github.com/concourse/skymarshal/pull/2))
* Concourse can now emit to Datadog using `statsd` agent
* The `semver` resource now supports an optional `commit_message` parameter
* The dashboard now supports the "not" operator for searches. This can be used on pipeline name searches, team searches, and status searches. Here are some examples:
     * `-main` gives you every pipeline other than the one called main
     * `team:-main` gives you every team's pipeline other than the ones belonging to main
     * `status:-paused` gives you all pipelines that are not paused
* The ATC will now batch-delete containers and volumes, rather than making
  individual calls out to the worker
* The ATC can now be configured with a global [`default build_logs_to_retain`](https://concourse-ci.org/jobs.html#job-build-logs-to-retain).
  This is useful for operators who want more control over their database usage.
  A maximum value can also be configured to ensure users don't set an unreasonable value.
  The flags are `--default-build-logs-to-retain` and `--max-build-logs-to-retain`.
* The `fly set-pipeline` command will no longer prompt `apply configuration?` if there are no changes to apply.
* There's a `fly order-pipelines` command now, which allows you to set the order of pipelines in the web UI.
* A `fly status` command has been added for checking whether or not you're logged in to the given target.
* When `fly check-resource` fails, it'll bubble up the error message rather than just saying `error code 500`.
* When a previously-created volume disappears from a worker and the ATC tries to
  use it, the error message will now include the worker name and the volume handle
* `git-resource` can be configured to disable the fetching of tags; you can do
   this by configuring `clean_tags: true` in `params`
* The `/dashboard` page is mobile responsive and looks better on small screens
* The `/dashboard` page makes way fewer requests now, so it's a lot faster to
  load and more efficient to periodically refresh.
* The `fly builds` command can now filter by team (`-t`) or pipeline (`-p`)
* Concourse now supports [AWS Secrets Manager](https://aws.amazon.com/secrets-manager/)
  for credential management. Please refer to our docs on [Using Amazon SSM](https://concourse-ci.org/creds.html#ssm)
* The Vault credential manager can now be configured with a `--vault-auth-backend-max-ttl`,
  after which it will force a re-login
* The Vault credential manager will now retry with exponential backoff when
  logging in, rather than retrying every second.
* The Git resource will now make the commit message accessible under `.git/commit_message`
* The web node can now be configured with `--cookie-secure` to force `secure: true` on its cookies.
* The Github Release resource now supports a `tag_filter` configuration for matching arbitrary semver tags
* The Docker Image resource now supports configuring `aws_session_token`
* The Docker Image resource now has a new param, `cache_from`. This new param is
  like `load_bases` except everything loaded will also be used as a cache during the build.
* `fly validate-pipeline` with `--strict` will now be more strict with your YAML
* The CF resource now supports `verbose: true`, which will tell the CLI to dump trace logs to the output.
* The Docker Image resource now supports a `target_name` param for specifying the
  target to build in a multi-stage `Dockerfile`.
* The BOSH release now bakes in the glue code for use with BOSH Backup and Restore.
  Caveats apply, see [PR #1975](https://github.com/concourse/concourse/pull/1975)
* The `fly set-pipeline` command can now be given `--no-color` flag to strip out the
  color from the diffs. Instead of using color, `+` and `-` will be at the start of
  added and removed lines.
* Now that we're building with Go 1.10+, `fly` will respect socks5 proxies
  configured via the "standard" `http_proxy`/`https_proxy` env vars.
* The concourse worker commands can now be pointed at multiple TSA addresses,
  rather than one, so that it can retry against a random node each time.
  As part of this, we've removed the `--tsa-port` flag and changed `--tsa-host`
  to instead take a `host:port`.
* We've revamped how `fly execute` gets its inputs and outputs to/from the build,
  so that configuring the ATC with an external URL is no longer required.
  See [#2069](http://github.com/concourse/concourse/issues/2069) for the nitty-gritty.
* We've switched back to `btrfs` as the default driver. This resolves a
  long-standing performance issue when using privileged tasks or
  resource types (like the [Docker Image resource](https://github.com/concourse/docker-image-resource)).
  For more information, see [#1404](https://github.com/concourse/concourse/issues/1404)
  and [#1966](https://github.com/concourse/concourse/issues/1966). Be sure to use
  the latest supported stemcell version so that you have a `btrfs` with the latest
  fixes. We suspect that this will still be an occasional issue, though far less
  frequent.
* The Docker Image resource now supports pushing multiple tags
* When the ATC is streaming data between workers, the stream will now be
  `gzip`-compressed, which should speed things up quite a bit.
* The ATC now requires TLS v1.2+ and a [stricter set of cipher suites](https://github.com/concourse/atc/blob/ed08aa96b357a19a6dca08608108cb6e07735aa7/atccmd/command.go#L703-L707).

###<a id="bug-fixes"></a>Bug Fixes
* Work around an apparent regression/behavior change in recent versions of Chrome
  that prevented the pipeline UI jobs from being clickable.
* Fixed a corner case in error handling that could cause a lock to be held
  forever when detecting new versions of resource types. This could lead
  to things like builds stuck in "pending" state.
* When directed to the login page from the resource page, you will now be
  redirected back to where you were
* The `concourse web` command is now capable of running the migration flags
 (`--current-db-version`)
* The `fly check-resource` command will now fail more clearly when the resource's type is not found.
* `fly` will once again helpfully instruct you to log in rather than just saying `error: forbidden`.
* The Time resource will now correctly handle a tricky configurations that span multiple days (e.g. 10AM - 5AM),
* Added a missing property to the BOSH release for configuring the Generic oAuth provider's CA cert.
* The Git resource will now recover from a deleted tag when configured with `tag_filter`
* Previously, tags on a resource type didn't get respected, that's been addressed now.
* Fixed an ATC crash that would occur when a `task` step errored with the next step using
  an `attempts` step modifier
* Concourse now supports the newer `umask`-hardened BOSH stemcells (v3541.x).
* Fixed a botched `bash`ism that led to the Docker Image resource to exit early
  on certain environments (more info [here](https://github.com/concourse/docker-image-resource/issues/170)).
* Cleaned up a noisy PostgreSQL error that would occur on start when checking
  for the legacy `migration_version` table.
* Fixed a UI glitch that caused the last line to be misaligned with the timestamps
  if it had no trailing linebreak.
* Fixed a couple migrations that assumed a `public` schema
* `fly` will no longer repeatedly error when given an invalid token during `fly login`.


## <a id="3-9-2"></a> Release Notes for Concourse v3.9.2
**May 8, 2018**

###<a id="known-issues"></a>Known Issues

###<a id="features"></a> Features
* Certificates can now be automatically propagated from the worker machine into
resource containers. This resolves GitHub issue [#1027](https://github.com/concourse/concourse/issues/1027).
This feature is enabled when you install Concourse v3.9.2. Please refer to the  OSS documentation
on [Certificate Propagation](https://concourse-ci.org/implementing-resources.html#resource-certs
) for more details.

* Tasks now support [`inputs.optional`](https://concourse-ci.org/tasks.html#input-optional)
* [CredHub credential manager integration](https://concourse-ci.org/creds.html#credhub) can now
be configured with mutual TLS based Authentication
* Teams can now be renamed via the `fly` command [`rename-team`](https://concourse-ci.org/managing-teams.html#fly-rename-team)
* `fly` target will no longer be deleted when running `fly logout`, just the token
* Resource page on the web UI will now show when it last checked
* `Docker Image` resource supports loading multiple images at the start via `load_bases` for use in multi-part Dockerfiles
* When using `fly intercept` with `--url`, the appropriate target will now be auto-detected based on the URL
* The Prometheus metrics endpoint now includes scheduling and database metrics
* Added support for NewRelic Insights metric emitter
* Added support for using AWS SSM for credential management
* The `CF resource` now has a `show_app_log` config for tailing the app logs while starting it up
* The `Docker Image` resource will now propagate `http_proxy` and `https_proxy` when building docker images
* The `Docker Image` resource can now be configured with `max_concurrent_downloads` and `max_concurrent_uploads`
* The `Github Release` resource will now produce a `commit_sha` file containing the commit sha that the release's tag points to
* Thet build page on the web UI can now render exotic ANSI text modes (e.g. faint text, framed text, Fraktur)


###<a id="bug-fixes"></a>Bug Fixes
* Modified a configuration on the `btrfs` volume driver, making it much more stable to use
* `Docker Image` resource now correctly handles complicated build arguments
* `s3-resource` will now auto-adjust the part size so it can upload files over 50GB
* Multi-part Dockerfiles with multiple ECR images will now correctly pull each with ECR login support
* Reduced the throttling when talking to k8s for credential management
* The Prometheus metrics endpoint no longer breaks HTTP metrics down by path
* When contacting CredHub, the configured CA cert is now respected. It was ignored in previous releases
* Fixed HTTP 500 errors when running `fly volumes` as a result of volumes disappearing while the API walks through and gets their info.
* Fixed missing validation for `on_success`, `on_failure`, and `ensure` when configured on a job
* Fixed a subtle timing issue that could result in `fly watch` not finding any builds to watch when given a job.
* We've optimized the rendering of the build page, which got quite a bit slower
with the introduction of timestamps in v3.6.0
* Fixed a crash that would occur when a `task` step configured `image` but no `config` or `file`\
* The `fly` CLI will now buffer output when rendering tables, which should make things a bit faster on Windows.
* Removed a database constraint `cannot_invalidate_during_initialization`
* Fixed an issue where builds would occasionally fail with `http2: no cached connection was available` when interacting with Vault
* Certain ANSI cursor movement escape sequences would wreak havoc on the Concourse build output page because there was no window size set on the TTY, thus defaulting it to 80x24. We've set it to 500x500
* Fixed an issue where Firefox users couldn't click around on the build page.

## <a id="3-8-0"></a> Release Notes for Concourse v3.8.0
**February 1, 2018**

###<a id="breaking-changes"></a> WARNING
If you are currently running a version of Concourse that is older than v3.6.0 and are planning to upgrade to v3.8.0, <strong>you must first upgrade to v3.6.0 before upgrading past it!</strong>

###<a id="known-issues"></a>Known Issues
* When configuring CredHub to Concourse, you may encounter a `certificate signed by unknown authority` error. Please see [GH Issue #1873](https://github.com/concourse/concourse/issues/1873) for more details

###<a id="breaking"></a>BREAKING
* Concourse now support both up and down migrations. In the future, this will allow you to back out of an upgrade and revert back to a previous version of Concourse. However, this work required us to squash our migrations, so you will need to first upgrade to Concourse v3.6.0 before upgrading to v3.8.0
* If you are upgrading from v3.6.0 you will be required to execute certain changes to your Concourse BOSH manifest.:
   * New required `atc` property, `token_signing_key`
   * New required `tsa` property, `token_signing_key`
   * New required `groundcrew` property, `tsa.worker_key`, type `ssh`
   * Removed `groundcrew` property, `tsa.private_key`, which was just the private key portion
   * Replaced `tsa` property, `host_key`, which is now of type `ssh`, containing both the public and private portion.
   * Removed `tsa` property, `host_public_key`; superseded by the above property
   * Removed `tsa` property, `authorize_generated_worker_key`; no longer means anything
   * The tsa `authorized_keys` property must now be specified. No workers are automatically authorized anymore.

You can consult our canges to [`manifests/single-vm.yml`](https://gist.github.com/vito/44cdf3aafcf4ba06349e24e8c21135eb) as a reference

Please also refer to Concourse BOSH release documentation on [`bosh.io`](http://bosh.io/releases/github.com/concourse/concourse?version=3.8.0)


###<a id="features"></a> Features
* The ATC can now be configured with an idle `timeout` for intercept sessions
* The Generic oAuth provider can now be configured with a CA certificate
* The Concourse Dashboard has been updated and has a new home under `beta/dashboard`. Tell us what you think about the new dashboard by commenting on our GitHub issue [#1829](https://github.com/concourse/concourse/issues/1829)
* The [`execute`](https://concourse-ci.org/running-tasks.html#fly-execute) command will now default to `-x`, which has been replaced with a new flag, `--include-ignored`, to rever to the old behavior. In addition, `fly` will gracefully handle executions with an input that doesn't have a `.gitignore`. It will also gracefully handle inputs that are files and not directories.
* The ATC will now use a separate database connection pool for the API and the pipeline scheduling work. This will make it so that slow API requests won't starve critical functionality.
* Pipeline-provided resource types will no longer fail for the first two minutes after configuration
* Jobs and steps now support [`on_abort`](https://concourse-ci.org/on-abort-step-hook.html)
* ATC can be configured with a pure-random worker selection strategy. This can be configured by passing `--container-placement-strategy=random` through the `web` command
* The [`jobs`](https://concourse-ci.org/managing-jobs.html#fly-jobs) command now has a column indicating whether any builds are pending or started for each job
* The [S3 resource](https://github.com/concourse/s3-resource) now supports being configured with a session token
* Git repos encrypted with `git-crypt` will now be automatically decrypted by the [Git resource](https://github.com/concourse/git-resource)
* The ATC can now be configured to serve a metrics endpoint for Prometheus
* Teams now support BitBucked-based auth
* The Git resource can now be configured with a HTTPS proxy
* Inline task configs are now validated as part of pipeline validation
* The CF resource can now be configured with a Docker username/password for pushing an app using a private repository
* The Github Release resource now supports being configured with insecure: true to support private GitHub Enterprise installations
* The Semver resource now supports being configured with skip_ssl_verification: true to support private S3-compatible blobstores
* ATC now has a flag for using k8s secrets when running in a cluster. This change makes using the k8s credential manager an explicit choice when running inside k8s, and also allows you to use a different credential manager when running in a cluster

###<a id="bug-fixes"></a>Bug Fixes
* When the ATC is configured with multiple metrics emitters, it will now error, rather than silently picking one
* Fixed an issue where selecting/copying the build output would also select the timestamp on the left.
* `fly login` will now error if arguments are mistakenly given to it
* Turns out you could easily spam the build page by holding `T` to trigger multiple builds. We've fixed that now so it only triggers a build once.
* Fixed the web UI so that it appropriately shows that you are logged out when your session expires.
* The deprecated Bosh Deployment resource resource contains the bosh CLI again
* Fixed an issue with the CredHub integration that made it necessary to configure `--insecure-skip-verify`

## <a id="3-6-0"></a> Release Notes for Concourse v3.6.0
**November 9, 2017**

###<a id="breaking-changes"></a> BREAKING CHANGES

####Postgres
Concourse 3.6.0 now **requires** you to install and manage an external
PostgreSQL database (v9.5+). We have enabled an upgrade path to the
<a href="https://github.com/cloudfoundry/postgres-release">CloudFoundry Postgres BOSH release</a> for your convenience.

<p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> You <strong>do not</strong> need to follow these instructions if your Concourse deployment already connects to an external PostgreSQL database (v9.5+).</p>

Migration Instructions:

1. If you have not done so already, upgrade your Concourse to 3.5.0. Concourse 3.5.0
includes a change to the postgres job that moves its data to a new location where
the Cloud Foundry Postgres release will detect and upgrade from.

2. Upload the Cloud Foundry Postgres release to your BOSH Director. Pivotal
tested this upgrade path with version 20, currently available on
<a href="http://bosh.io/releases/github.com/cloudfoundry/postgres-release?version=20">bosh.io</a>

3. Once the release is uploaded, add a reference to the job in your Concourse
 deployment manifest. You can do this by swapping out the `concourse/postgresql`
  job for `postgres/postgres`.

4. In the same Concourse deployment manifest, update the ATC properties to
explicitly configure the database name and role. These values will vary based on your
deployment preferences. You can refer to our <a href="https://github.com/concourse/concourse/commit/17be5f144a799e344c9d1bb56d9595ff164c96ef">
changes on the single-vm Concourse manifest</a> as a reference point.

5. Note that the Postgres DB upgrade **must not** be combined in the same deployment
operation as a stemcell update

####Garden runC
Concourse 3.6.0 now requires Garden runC 1.9.0. Make sure you download the appropriate
version of Garden runC and recreate your workers.

###<a id="features"></a>Features
* `fly validate-pipeline` will now validate the `config` field on embedded tasks.
As a part of this change we have removed support for configuring both `config`
and `file`, which has been deprecated.
* Build logs now have timestamps. You can find more about it on the feature post <a href="https://medium.com/concourse-ci/build-page-improvements-64ebe663a7ec">here</a>
* Build page now supports keyboard shortcuts. You can find more about it on the feature post <a href="https://medium.com/concourse-ci/build-page-improvements-64ebe663a7ec">here</a>.
  There is a known issue where keyboard shortcuts are non-functional on Firefox browsers. This should be fixed in a subsequent release.

### <a id="bug-fixes"></a> Bug Fixes
* Fixed an issue with pipeline scheduling that would result in high database connection usage.
* Fixed an issue where clicking and dragging on the pipeline view would send you to the job details page.


## <a id="3-5-0"></a> Release Notes for Concourse v3.5.0
**September 25, 2017**

### <a id="features"></a> Features

* Support for <a href="https://github.com/cloudfoundry-incubator/credhub">CredHub</a> for external credential management
* BaggageClaim volume creation APIs are now asynchronous
* Parallelized garbage collection. This should make things more durable to a slow worker, and make it harder for containers and volumes to "pile up" when the ATC is out of service briefly (i.e. during a deploy)
* BaggageClaim's response header timeout is now configurable, which should help those with large images that they're using for privileged tasks.

####Fly CLI
* When using groups in pipelines, `fly` will now let you know when you forgot to assign a job to a group
* `fly` now prints a URL to your build page when you run `execute`
* The fly command for <a href="https://concourse-ci.org/creating-and-updating-teams.html#fly-set-team">`set-team`</a> and <a href="https://concourse-ci.org/managing-teams.html#fly-destroy-team">`destroy-team`</a> now lets you supply the flag `--non-interactive`
* Jobs with a pending build now have a static halo to better represent its waiting state
* The `fly` CLI can now format a pipeline configuration into its 'canonical form' using the new <a href="http://concourse-ci.org/fly-format-pipeline.html">`format-pipeline`</a> command
* The <a href="http://concourse-ci.org/fly-abort-build.html">`abort-build`</a> command can now abort by build ID

####Resources
* The <a href="https://github.com/concourse/semver-resource">Semver resource</a> now supports Google Cloud Storage
* The <a href="https://github.com/concourse/bosh-deployment-resource">Bosh Deployment</a> resource now uses the latest BOSH CLI
* The <a href="https://github.com/concourse/semver-resource">Semver resource</a> now supports Server Side Encryption
* The <a href='https://github.com/concourse/git-resource'>Git resource</a> will now save the committer email to `.git/committer`

####Web UI
* The legend on the pipeline page will now auto-hide after 10 seconds.
* When switching between pipelines, the UI will now fit the pipeline in view.
* You can also press 'F' center a pipeline in view.

### <a id="bug-fixes"></a> Bug Fixes
* Jobs and resources with a forward slash in their name no longer error out when loading their details.
* Fixed a leak with goroutines that happens from <a href="https://concourse-ci.org/builds.html#fly-intercept">`fly intercept`</a>
* Check containers will no longer be brutally destroyed if they're used too close to their expiration time.
* Previously, if a resource or resource type was parameterized via a credential manager, its check containers and caches would be mistakenly garbage-collected. They will now be kept around.
* Fixed an issue where the pipeline view will reset after a state change on the pipeline.
* Added the appropriate headers to stop GitHub from caching badges
* Fixed an issue with the garbage collector that happens when deleting teams
* Files with the `setuid` and `setgid` permissions set on them will no longer have them removed. This used to be lost with the `chown` performed for namespacing the files. We'll now restore it after the `chown`.
* The flags for configuring GitLab oAuth are now present in <a href="https://concourse-ci.org/creating-and-updating-teams.html#fly-set-team">`set-team`</a>
* Fixed an underflow in BaggageClaim's volume size detection
* The `unpack` parameter in <a href="https://github.com/concourse/s3-resource">S3 resource</a> will no longer load the entire archive into memory, so it can be used for larger archives


### <a id="known-issues"></a> Known Issues
* A migration introduced in `v3.3.0` would load all the builds into memory and then process them, causing a lot of issues when upgrading. We optimized this migration to migrate build plans in batches, rather than all at once.
