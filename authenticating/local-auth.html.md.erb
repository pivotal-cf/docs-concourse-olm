This topic describes how to configure your team's authentication using Local Users.

## <a id="overview"></a> Overview
Continuous integration servers often contain many secrets that let them access source code and deploy apps.
It is important that those secrets remain well guarded.
Concourse provides options for both authentication and authorization to give you control over who can access your server and how much they can see.

Any number of the following providers can be enabled at any one time.
Users are given a choice when logging in as to which one they want to use.

<p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong>
If you access your Concourse server over the public internet, then consider using TLS to secure your connection to the web node.
</p>

Configuring team authentication in Concourse is done in two parts:

1. Configure the allowed authentication providers in the deployment manifest.
See [Configure Authentication Providers](#configuring) below.
2. Add users and groups to Concourse teams using `fly set-team`.
See [Add Users and Groups to Teams](#adding) below.

<%= partial 'configure-auth-providers' %>

### <a id="local-users"></a> Local Users
Local users must be declared in the `add_local_users` of the `atc` job in the deployment manifest.
Passwords can be supplied in plaintext or as a bcrypted string (minimum 10 rounds).

Example:
<pre class="code">
- user1:password1
- user2:$2y$10$W9542XKXzG5aedX09AlSg.nr0IwejlWosCWXzRKl1eOFzdpgOrGcG
</pre>

<p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong><code>user1</code> and <code>user2</code> mentioned above do not yet have access to any teams. They must be granted access on a team-by-team basis. For more information, see <a href="#adding">Add Users and Groups to Teams</a> below.</p>


### <a id="config-main"></a> The Main Team

<%= partial 'main-team' %>


## <a id="adding"></a>Add Users and Groups to Teams

<%= partial 'add-users-and-groups' %>


### <a id="add-basic-auth"></a> Local Users
You can grant local users access to a team using the `--local-user` flag:

<ol>
<li>Open a terminal window.</li>
<li>Enter the following command:<br/>
<pre class="code">
$  fly set-team -n YOUR-TEAM --local-user USERNAME
</pre>
</li>
</ol>


### <a id="team-config"></a> Team Configuration Details

<%= partial 'team-config' %>

The output is similar to the following:
<pre class="terminal">
<strong>name</strong>     <strong>users</strong>
main     local:User
</pre>

## <a id="user-roles-and-permissions"></a> Set User Roles and Permissions

<%= partial 'set-user-roles-and-perms' %>
