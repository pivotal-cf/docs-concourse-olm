Concourse for Pivotal Cloud Foundry (PCF) is a continuous integration and
delivery tool that lets you build and monitor scalable pipelines seamlessly.
This topic describes how to install Concourse and what you need to install it successfully.

## <a id="prereqs"></a> Prerequisites

Before you install Concourse for PCF, you must have the following:

* A supported IaaS provider: AWS, Azure, GCP, or vSphere
* A BOSH Director. For more information about the BOSH Director, see
[Deploying BOSH with create-env](http://bosh.io/docs/init.html) in the BOSH documentation.
<p class="note warning"><strong>Warning: </strong>It is not recommended to use a
  BOSH Director associated with an existing PCF deployment.
  This is because Concourse for PCF can conflict
  with other tiles deploying on Ops Manager at the same time.</p>

* BOSH CLI v2. For more information, see
[Installing the CLI](https://bosh.io/docs/cli-v2-install/) in the BOSH documentation.
* Concourse and Garden Run-C BOSH releases. Download these from
[Pivotal Network](https://network.pivotal.io/products/p-concourse/).
* The stemcell for your IaaS, for when you create your Concourse deployment manifest.
  To download an Ubuntu Xenial stemcell from Pivotal Network, see
  [Stemcells for PCF (Ubuntu Xenial)](https://network.pivotal.io/products/stemcells-ubuntu-xenial/).
* PostgreSQL v9.5 and later.
Concourse can be configured to connect to an external PostgreSQL database or a
BOSH-managed Cloud Foundry PostgreSQL release.
For more information, see [postgres/36](http://bosh.io/releases/github.com/cloudfoundry/postgres-release))
in the BOSH documentation.
<p class="note"><strong>Note: </strong> As of Concourse v3.6.0,
  the Concourse BOSH release no longer supplies an internal PostgreSQL.
  You must provide your own PostgreSQL database as of v3.6.0.


## <a id="setup"></a> Set Up and Install Concourse

To configure and deploy Concourse for PCF, do the following:

1. Modify the `cloud-config.yml` file according to your IaaS environment.
   For information, see [Updating Cloud Config](Updating Cloud Config) in the BOSH documentation.
1. Prepare the Concourse deployment manifest.
  You can write your own manifest or modify a template
  with your unique configuration. For an example of a manifest template,
  see the [concourse.yml](https://github.com/concourse/concourse-bosh-deployment/blob/master/cluster/concourse.yml) file
  in GitHub.
For more information about `Cluster Concourse deployment`, see
[concourse-bosh-deployment](https://github.com/concourse/concourse-bosh-deployment/blob/master/cluster/README.md)
in GitHub.
1. Configure authentication in your deployment manifest by providing `tls_cert` and `tls_key` values.
   For instructions, see [Authentication](./authenticating.html).
1. Prepare the `cloud-config.yml` file and upload it to your BOSH Director with `bosh update-cloud-config`.
1. Deploy Concourse with `bosh deploy`. For more information,
    see [Deploying](https://bosh.io/docs/deploying/) in the BOSH documentation.
    After Concourse deploys, a success message is displayed.
