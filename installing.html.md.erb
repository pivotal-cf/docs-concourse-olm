Concourse for Pivotal Cloud Foundry (PCF) is a continuous integration and delivery
tool that lets you build and monitor scalable pipelines seamlessly.

Concourse for PCF v3.13.x is no longer supported.

Instead of pursuing an installation of this version,
navigate to [Install v4.2.4](http://docs.pivotal.io/concourse-pcf/v4/installation)
or [Install v5.2.0](http://docs.pivotal.io/concourse-pcf/v5/installation) for
instructions on installing a supported version.

<%# ## Prerequisites
<ul>
<li>A supported IaaS provider: AWS, Azure, GCP, or vSphere</li>
<li>A <a href="http://bosh.io/docs/init.html">BOSH Director</a>. Do not use the BOSH Director associated with an existing PCF deployment.</li>
<li><a href="http://bosh.io/docs/cli-v2.html#install">BOSH CLI v2</a></li>
<li>Concourse + Garden Run-C BOSH releases downloaded from Pivotal Network</li>
<li>The stemcell for your IaaS, for when you create your Concourse deployment manifest.
  To download an Ubuntu Xenial stemcell from Pivotal Network, see
  <a href="https://network.pivotal.io/products/stemcells-ubuntu-xenial/">Stemcells for PCF (Ubuntu Xenial)</a></li>
<li>PostgreSQL 9.5+. Concourse can be configured to connect to an external PostgreSQL database or a BOSH managed Cloud Foundry Postgres release (available on <a href="http://bosh.io/releases/github.com/cloudfoundry/postgres-release">bosh.io</a>). <b>NOTE:</b> As of Concourse 3.6.0 the Concourse BOSH release no longer supplies an internal postgres. <em>You must</em> provide your own postgres database as of 3.6.0</li>
<li>If you are planning to use CredHub, Concourse 3.8.0 is compatible with CredHub 1.6.x. Concourse 3.8.0 is <strong>not</strong> compatible with CredHub 1.7.x
</ul>

## Setting Up and Installing Concourse
<ol>
 <li>Configure your IaaS environment by modifying your cloud config for BOSH deployment. </li>
 <li>Prepare the Concourse deployment manifest. You can write your own manifest or <a href="https://github.com/concourse/concourse-bosh-deployment/blob/master/cluster/concourse.yml">modify a template</a> with your unique configuration. You can read more about BOSH deployment configurations in the <code>concourse-bosh-deployment</code> repo for <a href="https://github.com/concourse/concourse-bosh-deployment/blob/master/cluster/README.md">cluster deployments</a><br/>
 <p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: You will also need to configure authentication. Follow the instructions in <a href="./authenticating.html">Authentication</a>.<br/>
Provide <code>tls_cert</code> and <code>tls_key</code> values in the manifest.</p></li>
<li>Prepare the <code>cloud-config.yml</code> file and upload it to your BOSH Director with <code>bosh update-cloud-config</code>.<br/>
<li>Deploy Concourse with <code>bosh deploy</code>.
    For more information,
    see the <a href="https://bosh.io/docs/cli-v2.html">BOSH CLI documentation</a> for more information.
    After Concourse deploys, a success message displays.</li>
</ol>
